Thoughts I have at work. I worked in pollinator ecology and conservation for over a decade; found biodiversity informatics, and had a chance to make a career out of it, so long as I left bees behind for marine biodiversity. I made the shift in March of 2023. Change is hard, and I'm still (and may always be!) adjusting.
