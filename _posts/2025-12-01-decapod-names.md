I've just read [this paper](https://peerj.com/articles/20337/) analyzing more than 23,000 decapod crustacean species names written by editors of the [DecaNet](https://www.decanet.info/index.php) database. They categorized names following a [similar analysis done on spider names in 2023](https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/198/2/494/7035017) and added [these categories](https://www.decanet.info/aphia.php?p=attrdetails&id=2888174&tid=586105) to each [species name](https://www.decanet.info/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=586105#attributes) on DecaNet now, which is a neat detail in addition to all they provide already! I've been in a species name database rabbit hole for months now; there's been so much to learn about the species I get to work with these days, and the information for marine species is really accessible (thanks, [WoRMS](https://marinespecies.org/)!), which has made the learning far more approachable and manageable than I thought it would be.

In the spirit of the "[How many species of bee are there?](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6372769/v1)" paper in review by Dorey et al., I think it would be interesting to see a similar analysis of bee species names. Creating etymological categories would be a fun piece of a future bee species name database, too!

Other cool informatics things I've read lately that sparked thoughts about wild bee occurrence data and conservation:
- GBIF and DNA -- I just learned that GBIF is [actively developing a metabarcoding data program](https://www.gbif.org/metabarcoding)
- [Guide to publishing biological survey and monitoring data to GBIF](https://docs.gbif.org/guide-publishing-survey-data/en/)
- [Taxonomic treatments in an updated Darwin Core conceptual model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TagnY3c39r_-S40yCImOiwBqN1bUhzM1qrH5ok8-bEI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z6c2qljc1msi) (this is a case study of the [new GBIF data model effort](https://www.gbif.org/new-data-model) that led to the development of the [Darwin Core Data Package](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/dp/), which is currently [under public review](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/))
  
After speaking at EntSoc a few weeks ago (my slides are [here](https://zenodo.org/records/17602649)), I updated the [Wiki](https://github.com/Big-Bee-Network/wild-bee-data-standard/wiki) of the *Wild Bee Data Standard* GitHub repository to share more resources on GBIF and Darwin Core and more papers to check out on using occurrence data.
